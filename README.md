## Short Description

The application helps the visually impaired user to get to a certain destination by giving real-time 
voice instructions (e.g. “Continue straight”, “turn to right” etc.). The user can interact with it by using 
the implemented Voice User Interface; as an extra feature – the user can find at any point on his journey his
current physical address and broadcast it to a list of friends (e.g. in case it needs help).
This application makes use of the cloud resources provided by Google Directions and Google Maps API, 
the support provided by Android platform for speech recognition, reverse geocoding and by using the aforementioned 
services the core functionality of the app, to provide directions guidance to the visually impaired user, is implemented.
The main functionality of the app is implemented by using an adapted version of Craig Reynold’s path following algorithm.
